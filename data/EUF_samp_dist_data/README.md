- Three pickle files 'k3_10000_obtained.pkl', 'k4_20000_obtained.pkl' and 'k5_1000000_obtained.pkl' contain the rankwise frequency distribution data of 10000, 20000 and 1000000 sampled EUFs respectively. The pkl file contain data for 3,4 and 5-inputs respectively.
The sampling has been done using our hypercube based EUF sampling algorithm proposed in the manuscript.
- 'EUF_sampling_distribution.pdf' is the rank-frequency distribution plots associated with these three datasets.
