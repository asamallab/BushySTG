### unique_perm_k
- There are 8 folders (for k = {1,2,...,8}) . Each of the folder contains four files with names <ensemble>_unique_perm.tsv. This files
  provide the number of non-equivalent pemutations ('No_of_unique_perms' in the file) for all or sampled BFs depending on the value of k
  and the ensemble.
### bio_2650_unique_perm_dataframe.tsv
- This dataset contains the number of non-equivalent(unique) permutations of the functions compiled from discrete models in published literature. It also contains the number of inputs to the function, total number of possible permutations and the fraction of non-equivalent
permutations over total number of possible permutations.
### avg_unique_perm.pdf
- the plot of average fraction of non-equivalent permutation with the number of inputs for the four classes of functions (EF, EUF, RoF and NCF) and for the functions provided in bio_2650_unique_perm_dataframe.tsv.
